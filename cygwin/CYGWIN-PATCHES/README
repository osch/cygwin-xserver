Build instructions:
  unpack xorg-server-N.N.N-N-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
	 unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./xorg-server-N.N.N-N.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/xorg-server-N.N.N-N-src.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/xorg-server-N.N.N-N.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/xorg-server-dmx-N.N.N-N.tar.bz2

-------------------------------------------

Port Notes:

----- version 1.10.3-1 -----
Version bump.
- On W7, use SHGetPropertyStoreForWindow() to set the System.AppUserModel.Id property in the
IPropertyStore object for a window to a string containing the X window classname, so the taskbar
can more correctly group windows belonging to the same X application

----- version 1.10.2-2 -----
- Ensure temporary file used to invoke xkbcomp is always removed
- Handle the virtual key code generated by the Fn key on IBM Lenovo laptops

----- version 1.10.2-1 -----
Version bump.
- Automatically activate the -nolock option if /tmp is on a FAT filesystem
- Automatically activate the -emulate3buttons option if less than 3 mouse buttons are reported
- Add -noemulate3buttons option
- Use system() rather than pipe() & fork() to invoke xkbcomp
- If GALLIUM_DRIVER env var is set, load swrastg rather than swrast
- In -wgl mode, create a new dispatch table, rather than modifying the existing one to avoid a GLX crash

----- version 1.10.1-1 -----
Version bump.
- Report if OS is WoW64 or not when reporting OS version
- Fix WM_ENDSESSION handling
- Remove _TrackMouseEvent pre-NT4 compatibility cruft
- Add an item to open the logfile to the default tray icon menu
- Allow XScreenSaverSuspend() to effect Windows screen saver or monitor power off
- Bug fixes for screen sizing when the screen window is on a non-primary monitor
- In multiwindow mode, don't grab native input focus for new windows which hint they don't want it

----- version 1.10.0-1 -----
Version bump.
- Fix clipboard integration when XSupportsLocale() fails by setting a known good locale
- Report XLocaleNotSupported result from X*TextPropertyToTextList()
- When using -from option, only the specified address is sent in the XDMCP REQUEST
- Tidy up OS version detection and reporting
- Don't bother reporting XORG_VERSION_CURRENT
- Remove some uninformative, always emitted log output
- Handle failure of winScreenInit() during startup without crashing
- Configure with --disable-glx-tls as default has changed from disabled to enabled if platform has TLS

----- version 1.9.4-1 -----
Version bump.
- Handle failure to get any GLX fbConfigs more gracefully: If we didn't
get any useful pixel formats from WGL_ARB_pixel_format, fall back
to using DescribePixelFormat().  If that doesn't give us any useful
pixel formats, fallback to software rendering.
- Decorate function pointers retrieved via GetProcAddress which are currently
missing it with WINAPI, so stdcall ABI is used.  This fixes a crash currently
seen when -screen option uses a size and monitor number e.g. -screen 0 1280x1000@2

----- version 1.9.3-2 -----
- Fix a crash which occurred using indirect rendering with some OpenGL applications e.g. ParaView by synchronizing
the indirect function dispatch table offsets with the current Mesa (7.8).  The need for this synchronization is an
unfortunate consequence of the way we currently work around some linkage problems with Mesa due to PE/COFF limitations.

----- version 1.9.3-1 -----
Version bump.
- Explicitly configure to use libgcrypt SHA1 implementation, rather than picking one depending on build environment,
so setup.hint dependencies are correct
- In WGL mode, handle GLX windows being reparented from a mapped window to an unmapped window correctly.

----- version 1.9.2-1 -----
Version bump.
- Rewrite of the way clipboard thread is started, which should improve clipboard robustness in XDMCP sessions
- Fix clipboard interaction with nxproxy (and possibly other X clients)
- Various clipboard improvements
- Fix WM_DISPLAYCHANGE handling in windowed mode to not resize the X screen
- Don't write list email address into log
- Fix random DPI after resize
- Implement WGL AIGLX for non-toplevel X windows

----- version 1.9.0-2 -----
- Fix a regression with window placement: Windows which remember their
position were drifting towards the bottom-right with each appearance
- Move log files to /var/log/xwin, which is created mode 0777, to avoid
logging failures in multiuser setups

----- version 1.9.0-1 -----
Version bump.
Added patches:
- fix a clipboard-related crash during XDMCP session startup
- added Turkish keyboard layout detection.
- add -displayfd option (experimental)
- crash fixes for -resize
- enable AIGLX code and -wgl option which has been merged upstream,
and various GLX fixes

----- version 1.8.2-1 -----
Version bump.
Support for RANDR display resizing was added.  In windowed mode, this
requires the XWin -resize option; in multiwindow mode, the display will
automatically resize to match a change in Windows display resolution.
Additional patches:
- Generate X keycodes for multimedia keys.
- Update mapping for Canadian keyboard layouts.
- Add -resize command line option.
- Internal WM workaround for Java AWT bug.
- Fix a GDI bitmap resource leak of window icons.
- Store pthread_ids and chain IOError handlers to avoid longjmp across threads.
- Make select() poll and not block if there are unprocessed Windows messages.
- Better keyboard debugging output.
- Show any fatal error message.

----- version 1.8.0-1 -----
Version bump.
Dependency on openssl replaced by libgcrypt.
Added patches:
- Make default DPI match Windows' DPI setting (usually 96).
- Process one Windows message per wakeup, rather than all of them:

----- version 1.7.6-2 -----
Added patch:
- Silence erroneous "/tmp mounted in textmode" warning.

----- version 1.7.6-1 -----
Version bump.
RECORD extension fixed and reenabled.

----- version 1.7.5-1 -----
Version bump.
Composite extension fixed and reenabled.
Added patches:
- Added XWinrc FORCEEXIT option to exit without asking for confirmation.
- If system.XWinrc is malformed, ignore it and try ~/.XWinrc.
- Added builtin menu configuration if no XWinrc is found.
- Remove logfile before writing to it.  This is a partial workaround for 
  logging failures in multiuser setups.
- /etc/X11/system.XWinrc will not be uninstalled if modified.

----- version 1.7.3-1 -----
Version bump.
Composite extension is temporarily disabled until fixed upstream.
Added patches:
- Restore -nolock option.
- Allow resizing of transient windows.
- Avoid log spam from Fedora 12 wait cursor.
- Avoid server termination when XDMCP kills internal clipboard manager.
  Clipboard integration will not be available but the session will continue.

----- version 1.7.1-3 -----
Added patch:
- Don't crash if conversion of window name to UTF-8 fails.
- Discourage other window managers from starting when in multiwindow mode.

----- version 1.7.1-2 -----
Added patches:
- Don't exit with error if locale is not supported by X11.
- Update and better organize options in -help output and XWin(1) manpage.

----- version 1.7.1-1 -----
Version bump for X11R7.5.

Restored support for XFree86-BigFont extension.
Support for Record extension has been temporarily disabled upstream.

----- version 1.6.5-1 -----
Version bump.
Added patches:
- Fix UT8String and CompoundText clipboard text sharing.
- Workaround for SWF/Motif bug in multiwindow mode.
- Tidy up system.XWinrc.

----- version 1.6.4-1 -----
Version bump.
Reverted patch:
- Use bash login shell to execute the commands started from the tray menu.
  This could cause lengthly delays in launching programs depending on the 
  contents of the user's .bash_profile.  Instead, xinit-1.1.1-5 launches
  XWin itself in a login shell, which should have the same effect.

----- version 1.6.3-1 -----
Version bump.
Added patch:
- NET_WM_ICON converters should not use icon alpha on Win2K or <32-bit display.

----- version 1.6.2-2 -----
Added patches:
- Always use an authorization cookie for internal clients (fixes clipboard
  integration in XDMCP sessions).
- Ensure WM_STATE atom exists in multiwindow mode (fixes BadAtom errors
  with Solaris X clients).
- Fix issue with X window menus sometimes appearing beneath the window
  which activated it.
- The -logverbose option now affects the verbosity of both the logfile and
  the console output.
- Add timestamps to logfile messages.

----- version 1.6.2-1 -----
Version bump.
Added patch:
- Use bash login shell to execute the commands started from the tray menu.

- reverted upstream clipboard change that wreaked havoc with other
  applications monitoring the clipboard (e.g. MS Office Clipboard, VNC).

(NOT multiwindow or mwextwm for now).

- remainder of Xming patch 15 (clipboard issues)
- additional clipboard debugging messages
- fix for flickering when resizing in multiwindow
- removed obsolete references to -co flag from Xserver manpage.
